# GIS Hospital Distance Analysis

Network analysis to map hospital accessibility zones within the GTA using ArcGIS

# Project description
This project performs a network road distance analysis to determine driving distances to hospitals within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The objective is to create an accessible and visually clear map using ArcGIS.

## Objective
- To calculate driving distances within 1, 2, 5, and 10 km of hospitals in the GTA using network analysis.
- To analyze hospital accessibility for emergency and planning purposes.

## Features
- **Data Preparation:** Clipped and reprojected Ontario-wide datasets to GTA boundaries.
- **Network Analysis:** Created a network dataset with road topology and calculated service areas.
- **Visualization:** Designed a map with clear symbology and usability, highlighting different driving distances.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Software:** ArcGIS
- **Data Sources:** Ontario road network, hospital locations, GTA boundary (data provided by Scholars Geoportal).
- **Skills:** Network analysis, data validation, geoprocessing, and data visualization.

## Results
- The final map outlines the accessibility zones (1, 2, 5, and 10 km) around hospitals in the GTA.
- Key insights include proximity of major hospitals to residential areas and potential gaps in accessibility.

## Files
- `Map_Output.pdf`: Final map showing hospital accessibility zones.
- `Documentation.pdf`: Report answering assignment questions and providing analysis.
- `Network_Analysis_Steps.md`: Step-by-step workflow for reproducing the analysis.
